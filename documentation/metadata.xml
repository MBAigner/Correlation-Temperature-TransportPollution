	<dc:subject>Correlation between the yearly average temperature of Innsbruck with the pollution emissions of NMVOCs from transport in Austria</dc:subject>
	<dc:description>
		This experiment treats the question if the emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds from transport in Austria have an influence on the yearly 
		average temperature in Innsbruck. This is done by comparing the trends of transport emissions and average temperature, as well as obtaining the correlation 
		between those two variables.
