# Comparison of the yearly average temperature of Innsbruck with the pollution emissions from transport

##Experimental overview
In this experiment, the question if the pollution emissions from transport in Austria have an influence on the yearly average temperature in Innsbruck will be treated.

This is done by comparing the trends of transport emissions and average temperature, as well as obtaining the correlation between those two variables.

###Input
For the average temperature of Innsbruck, the data provided under Open Data Austria (https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/5eb8278a-4ecf-41e2-a1f8-03383f31af7d) was in use.

For the transport pollution emission indicator, data provided by the EU Open Data Portal (http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset/gZmNXFTZrjPyK3EHPykmpg) was used.
